# til
Today I Leaned

## Usage

The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.

## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
